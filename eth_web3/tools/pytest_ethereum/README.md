# Overview

These `pytest-ethereum` tools include a few utilities to simplify handling EthPM packages. Specifically, deploying and linking contracts that are contained within an EthPM package. When the `py-ethpm` codebase was [ported](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/pull/1379) into `web3` to remove a circular dependency between `ethpm` & `web3`, these utilities were simultaneously ported over from [pytest-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pytest-ethereum), to avoid a similar circular dependency.

Complete documentation for how to use these utilities can be found on the [pytest-ethereum docs](https://pytest-ethereum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).
